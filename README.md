# You need to use Github to turn in your assignment #

## Prerequisites ##

You need to create a Github account and for each assignment, you need to create a repository. 
Note: your repositories will be public unless you [request a private one] ](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)


## The Process ##

 1. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) of your repository for the homework and make your changes in that branch.
 2. Commit and push your changes to the branch.
 3. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for the code you'd like to turn in.  Once you've setup the repository, you need to add MIDS-W205 as a collaborator. 
4. Your instructor can now view the pull request and grade the assignment.
 5. Once your instructor has graded the assignment, your pull request is merged as a final notification.
 6. You can now delete the branch as the changes have been merged with the master.
